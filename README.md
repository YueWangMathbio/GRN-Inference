# GRN-Inference
Code for the paper ""Inference on the Structure of Gene Regulatory Networks"" (arXiv:2107.13099)
Code written by Yue Wang with MATLAB 2021b (with Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox)
The goal is to implement different methods for gene regulatory network inference,
and test on simulated data.

"PBGv2.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 8.1.
"PBPv2.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 8.2.
"ADRv2.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 8.3.
"CIADR.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 8.4.
"PODE.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 8.5.
"PBADR.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 8.6.
"ACv2.m" is for the simulation in Subsection 10.2.
"plot.m" is for the plotting of Figs. 10-15.
